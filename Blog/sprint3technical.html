            <h2>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p>Html determines the structure of a page. Css determines how a page appears. JavaScript excutes logic. 
            When run in a web page, JavaScript has access to the page's html and css and can make change to them. JavaScript's main purpose is to manipulate html and css</p>
            <h2>Control flow and loops, arrays and objects</h2>>
            <p>Control flow allow the program flow to change within a unit of code or function. 
                These statements can determine whether or not given statments are executed, as well as repeated execution of a block of code. 
                Loops are used to executed the same block of code a specified number of times or while a specified condition is true. Very often when people write code, and want the same block of code to run over and over again in a row.
                Objects are collections of properties, and association between names, keys and values ect. people can define their own objects. 
                Arrays are used to store collections of data, but they often more useful to think of as colleciton of variables of the same types. </p>
            <h2>Functions and why they are useful</h2>
            <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to performa a particular task. 
                The main advantages of using funcitons: use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results. </p>
            <h2>The DOM and DevTools</h2>
            <p>When open any webpage in a browser, 
                the HTML of the page is loaded and rendered visually on the screen. To accomplish that, 
                the browser builds the Document Object Model of that page, which iis an object oriented model of its logical structure.
                DevTools are web development tools allow web developers to test and debug their code. The are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application.
                Web development tools come as brower add-ons or built-in features in web browsers. Such as Google Chrome, Firfox, Internet Explorer, Safari ect.
            Also allow to use with a variety of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, the DOMm JavaScript, and other components that are handled by the web browser.
