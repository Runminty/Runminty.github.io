        <div class="Myanswer">
            <div class="column1" style="background-color:white;">
              <h7 style="font-size:30px">what is Margin</h7>
              <p style="font-size:18px;  color:grey">Margin is CSS properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
                  There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left). --W3Shools

            <div class="column1" style="background-color:white;">
                <h7 style="font-size:30px">What is Border </h7>
                <p style="font-size:18px;  color:grey">The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.--W3Shools

              <div class="column1" style="background-color:white;">
                  <h7 style="font-size:30px">What is Padding</h7>
                  <p style="font-size:18px; color:grey">Padding is CSS properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
                    There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).--W3Shools

                </div>
          </div>
          </div>
          <h7 style="font-size:25px; color:grey">The difference is that while padding deal with the inner space, margin deal with the outer space to the next outer elements.
            Padding is the place inside border,margin is the place outside border. As the picture show below:</h7>
