           <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?

           <p>Neuroplasticity and growth mindset were surprised so much. </p>
           <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </h2>
           <p>some of the challengings are need to contact people I never spoken to, is very hard for me and learn to reflection is diffcult

           <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development
                bootcamp course?
            </h2>
           <p>Great learner can learn how to code anytime anywhere, techenology changing fast,we all going to learn new coding after few years time,
                however train yourself to be a good learner is hard. Most of time developers are working in the team with ohter people, these core learning 
                 will teach you to learn on your own and learn from your team  </p>
           <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
                practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </h2>
           <p>I don't feel is wasting my time. The core learning are same important to programing, I will spend right amout of time to it</p>
