    <h2><em>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration(Cultural Blog)</em></h2>
    <P style="font-size:18px">My parents owns a business in China, when I was little they hardly spend time with me, can't remember when was last time we went on a trip together. After I got married
      I had my first child and be a full time stay home mum. Family and Confidence are my values. I love my kids, I realise spending time with them is not enough, want to be their role model. 
      So I decide to join other people and gain my knowledge and skills better.</P>
