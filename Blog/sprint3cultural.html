            <h2>The difference between EQ and IQ</h2>
            <p>IQ is what determines people' competencies and indivdual capacities, 
                but EQ determins how people interact and treat others in their live. 
                The difference between these two is that no one can alter their own intelligence or reasoning abilities, 
                but anyone can learn to handle emotions, to bring future sucess</p>
            <h2>Why EQ is important and how it is relevant to me</h2>>
            <p>We live in the relational environment, to be able to social with others is basic of our life, 
                so having good EQ is matters a lot. After I having my kids, I realise, I can't stick to my own friends and family anymore
                I meet lots of stranger mums their children are friend of mine, so we have to catch up a lot for playdates, ect.
                Sommetimes there are confict between our kids with their, eg, they fight for toys, biting each other.etc 
                So where these type of awkward situations happens, EQ will be the best way helping me to solve it  </p>
