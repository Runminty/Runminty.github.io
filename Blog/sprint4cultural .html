            <h2>What is neuroplasticity? </h2>
            <p>Our brains are constantly being shaped by experience. Most of us have very different behaviours and thoughts today than we did 20 years ago. 
            This shift is neuroplasticity in action; changes in brain structure and organisation as we experience, learn, and adapt.
            With every repetition of a thought or emotion, we reinforce a neural pathway - and with each new thought, we begin to create a new way of being. 
            These small changes, frequently enough repeated, lead to changes in how our brains work. 
            Neuroplasticity is the 'muscle building' part of the brain; the things we do often we become stronger at, 
            and what we don’t use fades away. That is the physical basis of why making a thought or action over and over again increases its power. 
            Over time, it becomes automatic; a part of us. We literally become what we think and do.
            Neuroplasticity is at work throughout life. Connections within the brain are constantly becoming stronger or weaker, 
            depending on what is being used. Younger people change easily; their brains are very plastic. As we age change doesn't come as easily; 
            the brain loses some of its plasticity and we become more fixed in how we think, learn, and perceive. 
            Since the brain is pivotal to all we think and do, by harnessing neuroplasticity we can improve everything we do and think.</p>
            
            <h2>The principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
            <p>When your brain gets injured or damaged by disease, neuroplasticity allows you to recover. 
                Your brain reorganises its physical structure and the way it functions according to your environment.
                Neuroplasticity will not only help you recover from traumatic brain injury or stroke, but it can also help you 
                make your life better as you can rewire your brain to establish better habits that contribute to your health, success, and well-being.</p>
            <h2>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
             <p>When I do my study</p>
             <h2> What are some of the ways to increase my neuroplasticity</h2> 
             <p>Get enough quality sleep.
                Your brain needs sleep to reset brain connections that are important for memory and learning. 
                Just one night of losing sleep impedes the brain’s ability to reset itself, which impairs your memory. 
                For adults 26 to 64 years old, the National Sleep Foundation recommends 7 to 9 hours of sleep per day.
                Continue learning and keep moving.Whether it’s learning a new language or a type of dance, 
                the process of learning something new improves brain plasticity. Learning and practising a new language has been 
                found to strengthen the brain. You can also learn a musical instrument or an art skill.The brain benefits from learning 
                the way your body benefits from exercise. One study reveals that “the brains of the successful learners had undergone functional 
                changes — the brain network was better integrated.” But exercise itself is also beneficial to the brain. Cardiovascular exercises boost oxygen supply to the brain and increase brain volume. The Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise per week.
                Reduce stress.Stress is a silent killer, and it also diminishes neuroplasticity. 
                If you can’t reduce the sources of stress in your life, you can change how you respond to it. 
                An excellent way to de-stress is to surround yourself with nature or to travel. 
                Meditation is another way to control your stress responses.
                Find a strong purpose for what you’re planning to learn.Dr Michael Merzenich, author of Soft-Soft-Wired: 
                How the New Science of Brain Plasticity Can Change Your Life says that brain change will be more significant 
                if you’re motivated and alert. If you find a good reason for learning, then you will try harder and focus more on the task. 
                This has been found to enhance neuroplasticity.
                Read a novel.Researchers at Emory University have found that reading fiction creates heightened connectivity in the brain.
                Apart from this, reading stories provides a chance for you to relax.
                You can reshape your life by reshaping your brain. Start doing the tips above to increase neuroplasticity at any age.</p>

             <h2>what it Growth mindset and why it is relevant</h2> 
             <p>A growth mindset is “the understanding that abilities and understanding can be developed” (Mindset Works, n.d.). 
                 Those with a growth mindset believe that they can get smarter, more intelligent, and more talented through putting 
                 in time and effort.

                </p>
             <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
             <p> Acknowledge and embrace imperfections. View challenges as opportunities.
                 Try different learning tactics. Replace the word “failing” with the word “learning.”
                 Value the process over the end result.Cultivate a sense of purpose.Provide regular opportunities for reflection.
                 Place effort before talent.Learn from other people’s mistakes.Make a new goal for every goal accomplished.
                Think realistically about time and effort.
